Normal CGB Boot

The GBA does always boot in GBA mode, but the GBA BIOS does almost immediately
switch to CGB mode when detecting gameboy cart via Port 4000204h; that
detection relies on a mechanical switch in the cartridge slot, which does also
toggle the system voltage from 3.3V (GBA) to 5V (CGB).

GBA, GBA SP, and GBA micro

CGB mode is supported on GBA and GBA SP. The GBA micro does lack the cartridge
switch (and thus cannot detect 8bit carts, and cannot switch the system
voltage, nethertheless it does contain semi-functional CGB hardware: it can be
manually switched to CGB mode and execute the CGB intro).

CGB Bootrom Disable

The CGB Bootrom can be disabled via 4000800h, that allows to skip the CGB intro
(but requires booting custom GBA code with GBA intro and then hot plugging a
gameboy cartridge, which must contain a valid entrypoint at address 0000h, and
which must select CGB or DMG mode and initialize the DMG color scheme).

The Bootrom Disable works same as ROMDIS pin on real CGBs (and also includes
unlocking port FF60h, FF61h, FF63h, see no$gmb/pandocs for details).

Unknown if it's possible to keep the ARM CPU running after entering CGB mode
(so one could re-disable ROMDIS some cycles after booting).

Palette Issues

The GBA vs CGB palettes have different intensities ramps (CGB colors with
medium brightness will appear black on GBA), that's making CGB games mostly
unplayable on GBA (and only monochrome DMG games are actually working on GBA).
As a workaroud, one could tweak BLDCNT/BLDY to increase the brightness.
