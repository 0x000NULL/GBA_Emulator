  0E010000-0FFFFFFF   Not used

  10000000-FFFFFFFF   Not used (upper 4bits of address bus unused)

Default WRAM Usage

By default, the 256 bytes at 03007F00h-03007FFFh in Work RAM are reserved for
Interrupt vector, Interrupt Stack, and BIOS Call Stack. The remaining WRAM is
free for whatever use (including User Stack, which is initially located at
03007F00h).

Address Bus Width and CPU Read/Write Access Widths

Shows the Bus-Width, supported read and write widths, and the clock cycles for
8/16/32bit accesses.

  Region        Bus   Read      Write     Cycles
  BIOS ROM      32    8/16/32   -         1/1/1

  GamePak ROM   16    8/16/32   -         5/5/8 **/***
  GamePak Flash 16    8/16/32   16/32     5/5/8 **/***
  GamePak SRAM  8     8         8         5     **

Timing Notes:

  *   Plus 1 cycle if GBA accesses video memory at the same time.
  **  Default waitstate settings, see System Control chapter.
  *** Separate timings for sequential, and non-sequential accesses.
  One cycle equals approx. 59.59ns (ie. 16.78MHz clock).

All memory (except GamePak SRAM) can be accessed by 16bit and 32bit DMA.

GamePak Memory

Only DMA3 (and the CPU of course) may access GamePak ROM. GamePak SRAM can be
accessed by the CPU only - restricted to bytewise 8bit transfers. The SRAM
region is supposed for as external FLASH backup memory, or for battery-backed
SRAM.

For details about configuration of GamePak Waitstates, see:

GBA System Control

VRAM, OAM, and Palette RAM Access

These memory regions can be accessed during H-Blank or V-Blank only (unless
display is disabled by Forced Blank bit in DISPCNT register).

There is an additional restriction for OAM memory: Accesses during H-Blank are
allowed only if 'H-Blank Interval Free' in DISPCNT is set (which'd reduce
number of display-able OBJs though).

The CPU appears to be able to access VRAM/OAM/Palette at any time, a waitstate
(one clock cycle) being inserted automatically in case that the display
controller was accessing memory simultaneously. (Ie. unlike as in old 8bit
gameboy, the data will not get lost.)

CPU Mode Performance

Note that the GamePak ROM bus is limited to 16bits, thus executing ARM
instructions (32bit opcodes) from inside of GamePak ROM would result in a not
so good performance. So, it'd be more recommended to use THUMB instruction
(16bit opcodes) which'd allow each opcode to be read at once.

(ARM instructions can be used at best performance by copying code from GamePak
ROM into internal Work RAM)

Data Format

Even though the ARM CPU itself would allow to select between Little-Endian and
Big-Endian format by using an external circuit, in the GBA no such circuit
exists, and the data format is always Little-Endian. That is, when accessing
16bit or 32bit data in memory, the least significant bits are stored in the
first byte (smallest address), and the most significant bits in the last byte.
(Ie. same as for 80x86 and Z80 CPUs.)
