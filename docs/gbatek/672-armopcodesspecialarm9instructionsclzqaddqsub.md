```
Count Leading Zeros (CLZ)

  Bit    Expl.
  31-28  Condition
  27-16  Must be 0001.0110.1111b for this instruction
         Opcode (fixed)
           CLZ{cond} Rd,Rm  ;Rd=Number of leading zeros in Rm
  15-12  Rd - Destination Register              (R0-R14)
  11-4   Must be 1111.0001b for this instruction
  3-0    Rm - Source Register                   (R0-R14)

CLZ supported by ARMv5 and up. Execution time: 1S.

Return: No Flags affected. Rd=0..32.

Opcode Format (QADD/QSUB)

  Bit    Expl.
  31-28  Condition
  27-24  Must be 0001b for this instruction
  23-20  Opcode
          0000b: QADD{cond}  Rd,Rm,Rn    ;Rd=Rm+Rn
          0010b: QSUB{cond}  Rd,Rm,Rn    ;Rd=Rm-Rn
          0100b: QDADD{cond} Rd,Rm,Rn    ;Rd=Rm+Rn*2 (doubled)
          0110b: QDSUB{cond} Rd,Rm,Rn    ;Rd=Rm-Rn*2 (doubled)
  19-16  Rn - Second Source Register            (R0-R14)
  15-12  Rd - Destination Register              (R0-R14)
  11-4   Must be 00000101b for this instruction
  3-0    Rm - First Source Register             (R0-R14)

Supported by E variants of ARMv5 and up, ie. ARMv5TE(xP).

Execution time: 1S+Interlock.

Results truncated to signed 32bit range in case of overflows, with the Q-flag
being set (and being left unchanged otherwise). NZCV flags are not affected.

Note: Rn*2 is internally processed first, and may get truncated - even if the
final result would fit into range.
