Opcode Format

  Bit    Expl.
  31-28  Condition
  27-25  Must be 000b for this instruction
  24     P - Pre/Post (0=post; add offset after transfer, 1=pre; before trans.)
  23     U - Up/Down Bit (0=down; subtract offset from base, 1=up; add to base)
  22     I - Immediate Offset Flag (0=Register Offset, 1=Immediate Offset)
  When above Bit 24 P=0 (Post-indexing, write-back is ALWAYS enabled):
    21     Not used, must be zero (0)
  When above Bit 24 P=1 (Pre-indexing, write-back is optional):
    21     W - Write-back bit (0=no write-back, 1=write address into base)
  20     L - Load/Store bit (0=Store to memory, 1=Load from memory)
  19-16  Rn - Base register                (R0-R15) (Including R15=PC+8)
  15-12  Rd - Source/Destination Register  (R0-R15) (Including R15=PC+12)
  11-8   When above Bit 22 I=0 (Register as Offset):
           Not used. Must be 0000b
         When above Bit 22 I=1 (immediate as Offset):
           Immediate Offset (upper 4bits)
  7      Reserved, must be set (1)
  6-5    Opcode (0-3)
         When Bit 20 L=0 (Store) (and Doubleword Load/Store):
          0: Reserved for SWP instruction
          1: STR{cond}H  Rd,<Address>  ;Store halfword   [a]=Rd
          2: LDR{cond}D  Rd,<Address>  ;Load Doubleword  R(d)=[a], R(d+1)=[a+4]
          3: STR{cond}D  Rd,<Address>  ;Store Doubleword [a]=R(d), [a+4]=R(d+1)
         When Bit 20 L=1 (Load):
          0: Reserved.
          1: LDR{cond}H  Rd,<Address>  ;Load Unsigned halfword (zero-extended)
          2: LDR{cond}SB Rd,<Address>  ;Load Signed byte (sign extended)
          3: LDR{cond}SH Rd,<Address>  ;Load Signed halfword (sign extended)
  4      Reserved, must be set (1)
  3-0    When above Bit 22 I=0:
           Rm - Offset Register            (R0-R14) (not including R15)
         When above Bit 22 I=1:
           Immediate Offset (lower 4bits)  (0-255, together with upper bits)

STRH,LDRH,LDRSB,LDRSH supported on ARMv4 and up.

STRD/LDRD supported on ARMv5TE and up only, not ARMv5, not ARMv5TExP.

STRD/LDRD: base writeback: Rn should not be same as R(d) or R(d+1).

STRD: index register: Rm should not be same as R(d) or R(d+1).

STRD/LDRD: Rd must be an even numbered register (R0,R2,R4,R6,R8,R10,R12).

STRD/LDRD: Address must be double-word aligned (multiple of eight).

Instruction Formats for <Address>

An expression which generates an address:

  <expression>                  ;an immediate used as address
  ;*** restriction: must be located in range PC+/-255+8, if so,
  ;*** assembler will calculate offset and use PC (R15) as base.

Pre-indexed addressing specification:

  [Rn]                          ;offset = zero
  [Rn, <#{+/-}expression>]{!}   ;offset = immediate
  [Rn, {+/-}Rm]{!}              ;offset = register

Post-indexed addressing specification:

  [Rn], <#{+/-}expression>      ;offset = immediate
  [Rn], {+/-}Rm                 ;offset = register

Whereas...

  {!}      exclamation mark ("!") indicates write-back (Rn will be updated).

Return: No Flags affected.

Execution Time: For Normal LDR, 1S+1N+1I. For LDR PC, 2S+2N+1I. For STRH 2N.
