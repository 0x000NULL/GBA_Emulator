Coprocessor Register Transfers (MRC, MCR) (with ARM Register read/write)

  Bit    Expl.
  31-28  Condition (or 1111b for MRC2/MCR2 opcodes on ARMv5 and up)
  27-24  Must be 1110b for this instruction
  23-21  CP Opc - Coprocessor operation code         (0-7)
  20     ARM-Opcode (0-1)
          0: MCR{cond} Pn,<cpopc>,Rd,Cn,Cm{,<cp>}   ;move from ARM to CoPro
          0: MCR2      Pn,<cpopc>,Rd,Cn,Cm{,<cp>}   ;move from ARM to CoPro
          1: MRC{cond} Pn,<cpopc>,Rd,Cn,Cm{,<cp>}   ;move from CoPro to ARM
          1: MRC2      Pn,<cpopc>,Rd,Cn,Cm{,<cp>}   ;move from CoPro to ARM
  19-16  Cn     - Coprocessor source/dest. Register  (C0-C15)
  15-12  Rd     - ARM source/destination Register    (R0-R15)
  11-8   Pn     - Coprocessor number                 (P0-P15)
  7-5    CP     - Coprocessor information            (0-7)
  4      Reserved, must be one (1) (otherwise CDP opcode)
  3-0    Cm     - Coprocessor operand Register       (C0-C15)

MCR/MRC supported by ARMv2 and up, MCR2/MRC2 by ARMv5 and up.

A22i syntax allows to use MOV with Rd specified as first (dest), or last
(source) operand. Native MCR/MRC syntax uses Rd as middle operand, <cp>
can be ommited if <cp> is zero.

When using MCR with R15: Coprocessor will receive a data value of PC+12.

When using MRC with R15: Bit 31-28 of data are copied to Bit 31-28 of CPSR (ie.
N,Z,C,V flags), other data bits are ignored, CPSR Bit 27-0 are not affected,
R15 (PC) is not affected.

Execution time: 1S+bI+1C for MCR, 1S+(b+1)I+1C for MRC.

Return: For MRC only: Either R0-R14 modified, or flags affected (see above).

For details refer to original ARM docs. The opcodes are irrelevant for GBA/NDS7
because no coprocessor exists (except for a dummy CP14 unit). However, NDS9
includes a working CP15 unit. And, 3DS ARM11 uses CP10/CP11 as VFP floating
point unit.

ARM CP15 System Control Coprocessor

ARM Vector Floating-point Unit (VFP)

  24     P - Pre/Post (0=post; add offset after transfer, 1=pre; before trans.)

  22     N - Transfer length (0-1, interpretation depends on co-processor)

          0: STC{cond}{L} Pn,Cd,<Address>  ;Store to memory (from coprocessor)

          1: LDC{cond}{L} Pn,Cd,<Address>  ;Read from memory (to coprocessor)
          1: LDC2{L}      Pn,Cd,<Address>  ;Read from memory (to coprocessor)
          whereas {L} indicates long transfer (Bit 22: N=1)

Execution time: (n-1)S+2N+bI, n=number of words transferred.

For details refer to original ARM docs, irrelevant in GBA because no
coprocessor exists.

CDP supported by ARMv2 and up, CDP2 by ARMv5 and up.

Execution time: 1S+bI, b=number of cycles in coprocessor busy-wait loop.

Return: No flags affected, no ARM-registers used/modified.

For details refer to original ARM docs, irrelevant in GBA because no
coprocessor exists.
