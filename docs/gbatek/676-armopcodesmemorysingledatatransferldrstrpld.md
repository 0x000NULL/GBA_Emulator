Opcode Format

  Bit    Expl.
  31-28  Condition (Must be 1111b for PLD)
  27-26  Must be 01b for this instruction
  25     I - Immediate Offset Flag (0=Immediate, 1=Shifted Register)
  24     P - Pre/Post (0=post; add offset after transfer, 1=pre; before trans.)
  23     U - Up/Down Bit (0=down; subtract offset from base, 1=up; add to base)
  22     B - Byte/Word bit (0=transfer 32bit/word, 1=transfer 8bit/byte)
  When above Bit 24 P=0 (Post-indexing, write-back is ALWAYS enabled):
    21     T - Memory Management (0=Normal, 1=Force non-privileged access)
  When above Bit 24 P=1 (Pre-indexing, write-back is optional):
    21     W - Write-back bit (0=no write-back, 1=write address into base)
  20     L - Load/Store bit (0=Store to memory, 1=Load from memory)
          0: STR{cond}{B}{T} Rd,<Address>   ;[Rn+/-<offset>]=Rd
          1: LDR{cond}{B}{T} Rd,<Address>   ;Rd=[Rn+/-<offset>]
         (1: PLD <Address> ;Prepare Cache for Load, see notes below)
          Whereas, B=Byte, T=Force User Mode (only for POST-Indexing)
  19-16  Rn - Base register               (R0..R15) (including R15=PC+8)
  15-12  Rd - Source/Destination Register (R0..R15) (including R15=PC+12)
  When above I=0 (Immediate as Offset)
    11-0   Unsigned 12bit Immediate Offset (0-4095, steps of 1)
  When above I=1 (Register shifted by Immediate as Offset)
    11-7   Is - Shift amount      (1-31, 0=Special/See below)
    6-5    Shift Type             (0=LSL, 1=LSR, 2=ASR, 3=ROR)
    4      Must be 0 (Reserved, see The Undefined Instruction)
    3-0    Rm - Offset Register   (R0..R14) (not including PC=R15)

Instruction Formats for <Address>

An expression which generates an address:

  <expression>                  ;an immediate used as address
  ;*** restriction: must be located in range PC+/-4095+8, if so,
  ;*** assembler will calculate offset and use PC (R15) as base.

Pre-indexed addressing specification:

  [Rn]                          ;offset = zero
  [Rn, <#{+/-}expression>]{!}   ;offset = immediate
  [Rn, {+/-}Rm{,<shift>} ]{!}   ;offset = register shifted by immediate

Post-indexed addressing specification:

  [Rn], <#{+/-}expression>      ;offset = immediate
  [Rn], {+/-}Rm{,<shift>}       ;offset = register shifted by immediate

Whereas...

  <shift>  immediate shift such like LSL#4, ROR#2, etc. (see ALU opcodes).
  {!}      exclamation mark ("!") indicates write-back (Rn will be updated).

Notes

Shift amount 0 has special meaning, as described for ALU opcodes.

When writing a word (32bit) to memory, the address should be word-aligned.

When reading a byte from memory, upper 24 bits of Rd are zero-extended.

LDR PC,<op> on ARMv4 leaves CPSR.T unchanged.

LDR PC,<op> on ARMv5 sets CPSR.T to <op> Bit0, (1=Switch to Thumb).

When reading a word from a halfword-aligned address (which is located in the
middle between two word-aligned addresses), the lower 16bit of Rd will contain
[address] ie. the addressed halfword, and the upper 16bit of Rd will contain
[Rd-2] ie. more or less unwanted garbage. However, by isolating lower bits this
may be used to read a halfword from memory. (Above applies to little endian
mode, as used in GBA.)

In a virtual memory based environment (ie. not in the GBA), aborts (ie. page
faults) may take place during execution, if so, Rm and Rn should not specify
the same register when post-indexing is used, as the abort-handler might have
problems to reconstruct the original value of the register.

Return: CPSR flags are not affected.

Execution Time: For normal LDR: 1S+1N+1I. For LDR PC: 2S+2N+1I. For STR: 2N.

PLD <Address> ;Prepare Cache for Load

PLD must use following settings cond=1111b, P=1, B=1, W=0, L=1, Rd=1111b, the
address may not use post-indexing, and may not use writeback, the opcode is
encoded identical as LDRNVB R15,<Address>.

PLD signalizes to the memory system that a specific memory address will be soon
accessed, the memory system may use this hint to prepare caching/pipelining,
aside from that, PLD does not have any affect to the program logic, and behaves
identical as NOP.

PLD supported by ARMv5TE and up only, not ARMv5, not ARMv5TExP.
